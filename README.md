# Gauss-Jordan Elimination

Solve system of equations using Gauss-Jordan elimination method (reduced row echelon form).

# Usage

```
python main.py
```

The program follow these main steps:

1. generate `user_manual.txt` file the teachs the user how to write his equations
2. the user should create `equations.txt` file that contains the equations but must follow the schema
3. when the user is done with his equations he/she type `y` or `Y` to continue
4. the file `solution.txt` will be created containing the solution which is either of:
    - No solution
    - Infinite number of solutions
    - Only one solution

# Shout out

Thank to my great team ❤️.

We worked togther in about 2 days and distributed work between us. Made a presentation of the project in front of the great community of IEEE/ZSB/CS. Also learnt more tricks and features in Python and Gauss-Jordan elimination method.
